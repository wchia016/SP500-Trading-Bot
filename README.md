# PSAR, Bollinger Band Width and 200EMA Trading Bot

### Introduction
It is widely accepted that index investment is the best long-term investment method and that it is difficult to consistently beat the market year-on-year. However, index funding is still susceptible to negative price movements in times of high volatility which can affect the returns of an investor, especially if a new investor bought at the top. The goal of this trading bot is to ride up the natural bullish tendencies of indices while also reacting when necessary to possible sudden price falls to protect one's returns.
